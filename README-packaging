The distro-specific packaging targets are now integrated into the 
top-level build system. You should need to do no more than:

make VERSION=<Version> UNOFFICIAL_RELEASE=1 dist

to build debs and rpms, along with the source and binary tarballs. If
you just want to build one package, you can use the targets
debian_packages, rpm_packages or java_packages in the top-level
Makefile.

You need to have cdbs installed to build the Debian packages, and rpm 
for the Fedora packages.

The property UNOFFICIAL_RELEASE is used to determine whether packages 
should be signed - if the variable is set then they will not be 
signed, otherwise they will be. The signing key ID is 056E8E56 and is 
"owned" by simon@lshift.net.

UNOFFICIAL_RELEASE is also used by the Debian target to determine 
changelog behaviour. If it is not set, then debian/changelog must 
contain an entry for the version string in <Version>. If it is set, 
it creates a fake changelog entry.
