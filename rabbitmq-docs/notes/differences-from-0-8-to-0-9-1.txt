Semantically, there are few differences between 0-8 and 0-9-1; here's
a summary of the differences from the specification XML:

 - The advertised version number is major=0,minor=9,revision=1 rather
   than major=8,minor=0.

 - Frame types 4-7 (OOB and trace frames) have been removed, as they
   were not well specified in AMQP 0-8.

 - Status code changes:
	- Removed:
		NOT_DELIVERED		310
	- Added:
		NO_ROUTE		312 (missing from spec???)
		NO_CONSUMERS		313
		PRECONDITION_FAILED	406
		UNEXPECTED_FRAME	505

 - Access tickets have been removed. This involves the removal of the
   Access.Request method, and the deprecation of each and every ticket
   field in methods that used to require a ticket.

 - The restrictions on virtual-host names have been removed.

 - The notions of "known hosts" and of connection redirection have
   been removed.

 - The (AMQP-specific) "PLAIN" security mechanism is no longer
   mentioned.

 - The meaning of "channel-max" has been clarified: for example, if
   channel-max is set to 2, then it is illegal to use channels
   numbered 3 or higher for frames carried by the connection.

 - A new rule (named "upper-limit") regarding channel-max has been
   added: if the server can't support the requested channel-max, the
   connection MUST be closed without attempting a negotiated close.

 - The extensibility of the exchange-type mechanism is now explicitly
   documented.

 - The rules for equivalence of exchange instances in Exchange.Declare
   have been more clearly specified, including a specification of how
   the "arguments" tables are to be compared.

 - Auto-deletion of exchanges is no longer supported.

 - The AMQP 0-8 notion of "content classes" has been removed.

 - The rules for equivalence of queues in Queue.Declare have been more
   clearly specified.

 - The rules regarding declaration of "exclusive" queues have been
   more tightly specified.

 - A single Basic.Publish is now defined to never result in multiple
   copies of a message on any particular queue, even in the presence
   of multiple independent bindings to the same queue that match the
   published message.

 - Durable queues may now bind to transient exchanges. Bindings
   between a durable queue and an exchange are as durable as the bound
   exchange is.

 - The error code for use of an empty queue name in Queue.Bind (and
   other methods that use the most-recently-declared-queue mechanism)
   has been changed.

 - The empty string may now be specified in Queue.Bind's "exchange"
   field; it signifies the default exchange (!).

UP TO: JUST FINISHED QUEUE.BIND-OK. NEXT: Split the docs using some
XSLT or something and compare them using that. Plain-old-diff isn't
giving very good results at this point.

 - Some methods have been removed:

   Connection.Redirect
   Channel.Alert

 - Some methods have been renumbered:

                        AMQP 0-8        AMQP 0-9-1
   Connection.Close     60              50
   Connection.CloseOk   61              51

 - Some methods have been added:

   Queue.Unbind, methodId 50
   Queue.UnbindOk, methodId 51

 - Some methods have new or changed arguments:

   (many methods)	short		Ticket			deprecated
   Channel.Open		shortstr	Capabilities		deprecated
   Channel.Open		bit		Insist			deprecated
   Channel.OpenOk	shortstr	KnownHosts		deprecated
   Exchange.Declare	bit		AutoDelete		deprecated
   Exchange.Declare	bit		Internal		deprecated
   Basic.Consume	table		Filter			added
   File.Consume		table		Filter			added
   Stream.Consume	table		Filter			added

 - Some classes have been removed:

   Access
   Test

Framing and connection establishment (modulo the removed frame-types
and the spec version number advertisement, respectively) are
identical.
